  /**
   * Returns a Provider or Signer object representing the Ethereum RPC with or without the
   * signing capabilities of metamask attached
   *
   * A `Provider` is needed to interact with the blockchain - reading transactions, reading balances, reading state, etc.
   *
   * A `Signer` is a special type of Provider used in case a `write` transaction needs to be made to the blockchain, which involves the connected account
   * needing to make a digital signature to authorize the transaction being sent. Metamask exposes a Signer API to allow your website to
   * request signatures from the user using Signer functions.
   *
   * @param {*} needSigner - True if you need the signer, default false otherwise
